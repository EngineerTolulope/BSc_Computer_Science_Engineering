Fourth task: 
Write C program that creates a brand new bmp image file according to these:  
-resolution 200x200 
-color depth: 24 bit
-it contains 4 100x100 quartes of different colors (red, green, blue, yellow). The image will be similar to the 2x2 example in the attached image, just greater.
-so there is no source image, every field is created by your program.
